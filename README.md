sql tasks from leetcode.

its written in MYSQL, and i gives a picture of a portion of the sql can do.

I am working on a more advanced repository that covers SQL concepts such as Triggers, Views, Stored Procedures, 
and SQL optimization techniques, including Indexes (clustered and non-clustered). 

I want to understand why certain queries are faster and how SQL engines loop through tables and records during execution.

its called "Advanced SQL" or similar.
